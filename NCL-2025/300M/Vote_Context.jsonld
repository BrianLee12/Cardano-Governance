    "comment": "A NCL of 300 Million ADA is too high to be considered fiscally responsible. Submitted budgets have not reasonably proven this amount of ADA is necessary, so I cannot in good conscience approve this level of spending. \n\nI am willing to approve a NCL of ~200 Million ADA, and will do so if a GA is submitted to support this. \n\nIf we had community pooled GA supported tooling from Intersect / gov.tools / IOG this would be a non-issue, as average Cardano community members would have been able to submit their own GAs and this would be done already.\n\nI'm disappointed that this necessary tooling has been withheld and was promised as part of a compromise for a 100 Million ADA deposit for GAs."
