    "comment": "This is an overall good vision of the next stage in the Cardano roadmap.\n\nAlthough the details are fairly general, this is enough to work with as a vision for the future. More specific details, like timelines and budgets should definitely be built out and supplied for the Cardano Budget, since they are not present here.\n\nOverall, the categories present some solid goals, but I am disappointed with the SPO Improvements category.\n\nBoth suggestions presented (min margin and modified pledge-benefit for a0) have been researched and assessed by the Cardano community and IOG for a long time without any implementation or effort to be put into effect.\n\nI would have expected new suggestions here or new ideas to present to the community, since the previous improvements were not deemed important or significant enough by IOG to implement in the past.\n\nIf we are going with this line of thinking, then adjusting the K parameter to 1000 should also be presented as an SPO Incentive Improvement.\n\nI think what needs to be addressed is primarily the issue of large pool operations that control a significant portion of the network, reducing the effectiveness of K. \n\nAddressing sticky stake to retired pools and providing backup pool selections on initial delegation would be some key issues to solve for which would help with SPO Incentive Improvements.\n\nHopefully there is much more intended work to be done in this category, as it is the one that is lacking compared to the other categories."
